## Assignment 2 
1) Follow the instructions to set the environmental varaible and then get a csv file using curl command. Then I moved it into the PUIdata folder, read it, and perform operations. Please look at HW2_ty1045.ipynb for my answer.
2) Use API to read in a json with time data, and use pd.to_datetime to transform it into timestamp. Then plot time against total housing units and low income housing units.
