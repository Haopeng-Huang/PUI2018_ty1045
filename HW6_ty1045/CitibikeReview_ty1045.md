## Citibike Review
### Reviewer: Tiancheng(Gabriel) Yin - ty1045

### Null Hypothesis 
Your null hypothesis is fairly interesting since comparing those two groups can help us learn a lot about the riders. You expressed it correctly in both the words and the formula. 

### Data
You did an excellent job creating features and selecting data that you need. I believe the data you choose and the features you create can be used effectively to test whether or not your hypothesis is correct. Your bar graph clearly display the two groups that you're trying to compare and their respective mean. The data you provided is sufficient in testing the hypothesis.

### Tests 
#### Z Test
#### T Test
#### Chi-Square Test
