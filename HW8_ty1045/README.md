### Assignment II

I finish the citibike analysis and Perform the appropriate statistical test. I merged the pull requests from professor and take the advice and suggestions. And I write the analysis in an Authorea article.

Changes I made compared to HW4:

1) Null hypothesis: Average Trip Duration(customers) <= Average Trip Duration(subscribers)
   Alternative: Average Trip Duration(customers) > Average Trip Duration(subscribers)
2) I used T-test for two means. I used data from both the summer time(2016.7) and winter time (2016.1) to prove the robostness of my test.
