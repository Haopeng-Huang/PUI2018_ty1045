#  Idea: 

A subscriber will stay longer on bikes compared to a customer.

ok but you should motivate it: why is it interesting?

# Null Hypothesis ($H_0$)

The average travel time of subscribers will be greater than that of customers.
$H_0$ : Average(customer) < Average(subscriber)

No: the NH shold be the opposite of the idea! if you want to prove tht subscribers buke longer than customers you need to disprove the opposite: 

The average travel time of subscribers will be _lesser or equal_ than that of customers.
$H_0$ : Average(customer) >= Average(subscriber)

# DATA
the data preparation supports the test, though you will also need to obtain the standard deviation of the 2 groups

# TEST

a test for differnce in mean of samples: t- test for example. However since the distributions are likey not Gaussian a non parametric test would be more approprite, like the Mann-Whitney U test. Though with large numbers the t-test with the assumption on Gaussianity is likely justified
